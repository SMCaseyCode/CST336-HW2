Difficulties faced: <br>
- Placing event listeners on generated HTML elements
- Local storage implementations with more complex "data types" (more than just a string)
- Fully utilizing selectors
- Writing everything without deleting local storage once then being surprised something broke at the end and had to go through past revisions  to figure out what broke it. Shoutout to Github.

What I Learned: <br>
- How to place event listeners on generated HTML elements
- How to effectively use .forEach, extremely useful
- How to store arrays and objects in local storage by using JSON parsing/stringify
- Local storage should be deleted often when testing JS code
- The value of version history
